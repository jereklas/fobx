   * 1. Date.now() -- insufficient as 2 calls to function could result in same value if within the same millisecond
   * 2. performance.now() -- worst performance of "valid" options
   * 3. if(id === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {id = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER} -- this was surprisingly slow.
   *
   * The modulo solution was the best performing and the overflow limit of 1 million makes any
   * theoretical duplicate value so unlikely. Plus the worst that happens if a duplicate is met would be
   * something re-calculating one time more than it should.
